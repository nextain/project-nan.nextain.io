# Development Cycle — naia.nextain.io
# Read this BEFORE any coding task.

cycle:
  - phase: PLAN
    actions:
      - Clarify requirements with user
      - Identify affected files
      - Check existing code for duplicates
    output: "Clear scope and file list"

  - phase: CHECK
    actions:
      - Search codebase for related patterns
      - Read relevant files before modifying
      - Verify no conflicting changes
    output: "Understanding of current state"

  - phase: BUILD
    approach: TDD
    actions:
      - "RED: Write failing test for the feature/fix"
      - "GREEN: Write minimal code to pass"
      - "REFACTOR: Clean up while tests stay green"
    rules:
      - Never code without test first
      - Integration tests preferred over unit tests
      - No console.log — use structured patterns

  - phase: VERIFY
    actions:
      - Run tests (npm test)
      - Run dev server (npm run dev) and check manually
      - Verify in browser if UI change
    rules:
      - Type check alone is NOT verification
      - Actually run the app

  - phase: CLEAN
    actions:
      - Remove unused imports/files
      - Check for duplicate code
      - Self-review all changes

  - phase: COMMIT
    actions:
      - Stage specific files (no git add -A)
      - "Commit: <type>(<scope>): <description>"
      - Update work-logs if significant
