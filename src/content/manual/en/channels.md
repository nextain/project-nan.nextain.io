## Messenger Notifications (Webhooks)
Cafelua OS inherits OpenClaw's powerful channel system.
By entering your Slack, Discord or Google Chat Webhook URL in the **Settings > Tools > Webhooks** menu or during the initial onboarding screen, the AI avatar can send you messages with the results of important tasks.

> **Tip:** "Let me know on Discord when this file backup is completely finished!"

## Advanced: Build a 24/7 Autonomous Bot
By utilizing the terminal command tool (`execute_command`), you can turn the AI avatar into a 24/7 autonomous agent that resides in Telegram or Discord, beyond just your desktop.

Command the AI avatar in the chat like this:
> "My Telegram bot token is `1234:ABC...`. Run `openclaw channels add --channel telegram --token 1234:ABC...` to start my Telegram bot."

Now, even if you close the desktop app, you can chat with the AI avatar and assign tasks anytime through Telegram on your phone via the background OpenClaw Gateway.
