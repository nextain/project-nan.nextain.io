## What is Naia?
Naia is a personal AI OS where your own AI lives. It's not just a chatbot — it's an operating system that gives you full sovereignty over your AI. You decide which AI to use, what memories and personality it has, what voice and appearance it takes.

## How is Naia different from other AI tools?
Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot lock you into a single platform's AI, and their code is closed. Naia is **open source (Apache 2.0)** and gives you freedom of AI choice at the OS level. Cloud or local AI — you choose. Memory, personality, and settings are all stored on your machine. You can inspect, modify, and contribute to the source code. A truly personal AI.

## Is Naia open source?
Yes. Naia is an open-source project under the Apache License 2.0. Anyone can inspect, modify, and freely use the source code. Being able to verify in code exactly how AI handles your data is a fundamental difference from closed AI services.

## Which AI providers are available?
5 cloud providers (Gemini, Claude, GPT, Grok, zAI) and local AI (Ollama). Cloud AI uses Naia credits for convenience. Local AI (Ollama) is completely free — no credits needed. Local models keep your data on your machine, guaranteeing complete privacy.

## How do credits work?
Credits are deducted per request based on token usage and model pricing. The FREE plan includes a signup bonus and monthly refill. If you use local AI (Ollama), no credits are needed at all.

## How do I install the desktop app?
Sign in on naia.nextain.io, issue a connection key, and enter it in Naia. Available as Flatpak/AppImage/DEB/RPM or a bootable USB OS image.

## Is my data safe?
Naia's core principle is local-first. AI memory, personality, and conversation history are stored on your machine. With local AI, no data leaves your computer. For cloud AI, credentials are managed securely server-side.

## What's coming in the future?
Starting with VRM 3D avatars today — real-time video avatars, singing and gaming with your AI, and ultimately Physical AI (android OS). The goal is a truly "your own AI".
